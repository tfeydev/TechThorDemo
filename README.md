TechThorDemo
TechThorDemo is a robust and flexible system that allows users to define, manage, and combine data sources such as CSV, JSON, APIs, and databases. The platform ensures dynamic validation, normalization, and configuration while offering a user-friendly dashboard for seamless interaction.

Features
Dynamic Source Management:

Add, update, delete, and manage data sources via the interactive dashboard.
Automatically analyze, validate, and normalize source data (e.g., CSV structure) upon upload.
Data Consistency:

Leverages Pandas for consistent data normalization and validation.
Saves configurations in a unified YAML format.
Interactive Dashboard:

Provides a table-like interface for source management.
Displays analyzed and normalized data with filled and required fields.
API Integration:

Exposes configurations and combined datasets through REST APIs.
Allows users to select multiple sources and merge them into a new endpoint.
Flexibility and Transparency:

Ensures the system is intuitive and comprehensible for users.
Dynamically adapts to user input while maintaining stability.
Workflow Overview
Step 1: Create YAML Configuration from the UI
Customer Input:

Enter details such as name, type, filepath, delimiter, and encoding.
Upload the file (e.g., CSV) at the specified filepath.
System Process:

Automatically reads the file to analyze its structure and validate the format.
Normalizes the data, fills required fields, and identifies missing fields.
Displays the processed data in the UI for customer review.
Step 2: Update and Delete Sources
View existing sources in the interactive dashboard.
Inline edit configurations or open a dialog for updates.
Use the delete option to remove sources with confirmation.
Step 3: Provide Configurations as a DataFrame
Convert saved configurations from YAML to a Pandas DataFrame.
Display the DataFrame on the dashboard for customer review.
Export configurations in CSV, Excel, or JSON formats for offline use.
Step 4: Load Data from YAML and Expose It via API
Dynamically load configurations from the YAML file.
Expose structured data as REST API endpoints for integration.
Provide filters to retrieve specific configurations (e.g., all API sources).
Step 5: Combine Multiple Sources into a Unified Endpoint
Allow customers to select multiple sources from the dashboard.
Dynamically merge and normalize data (e.g., join operations).
Provide an API endpoint for the combined dataset with preview options.
System Architecture
Frontend
Dashboard Component:
Displays sources and their actions (view, edit, delete).
Provides entry points for adding new sources and viewing combined endpoints.
Dynamic Form Handling:
Automatically generates forms based on source type schemas.
Real-time validation for user inputs.
Backend
Source Analysis:
Reads uploaded files to analyze structure (e.g., column types for CSV).
Validates and normalizes data before adding it to the configuration.
Configuration Management:
Normalized data is saved in a YAML format for consistency.
Exposes APIs for fetching, updating, and combining configurations.
Persistence
YAML Format:
Stores configurations in a human-readable and maintainable YAML format.
Serves as the single source of truth for system configurations.

Example Workflow
Adding a New Source
Click + Add Source in the dashboard.
Enter source details:
Name: Unique identifier for the source.
Type: e.g., CSV, API.
File Path: Path to the file or endpoint.
Delimiter and Encoding (if applicable).
Upload the file or provide the URL.
The system analyzes the source:
Identifies columns and validates the structure.
Fills missing fields and normalizes the data.
Adds the source to the configuration and displays it in the dashboard.
