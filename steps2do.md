Complete Summary: Steps to Enable the Analytics Hub
Immediate Priorities
Real-Time Preview Updates

Ensure any updates (e.g., changes to params, file paths, or queries) in the source are immediately reflected in the preview.
Reload data dynamically without requiring manual intervention or page reload.
Cloud Storage and Databases Integration

Add support for remote and cloud-based file storage (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive).
Implement connections for additional databases like MySQL and MongoDB.
Enable flexible configuration for these sources via config.yaml or a UI-based wizard.
Data Normalization

Allow customers to:
Select columns to keep.
Rename columns for consistency.
Handle missing data (e.g., fill, drop, or interpolate).
Standardize data types across all sources.
Data Transformation

Build tools for:
Grouping and aggregation.
Merging sources via drag-and-drop interface (e.g., joining CSV with database tables).
Reshaping data (e.g., pivoting or splitting columns).
Data Validation

Add validation rules for detecting:
Inconsistent or missing data.
Duplicated rows.
Outliers in numerical columns.
Data Export and Storage

Store processed data in efficient formats like Parquet or databases (e.g., PostgreSQL).
Allow customers to export normalized/processed data in their preferred format.
Analytics Hub Foundation
Basic Visualizations

Include simple charts like bar plots, line charts, and histograms.
Enable data slicing for visual exploration (e.g., filters and groupings).
Data Summaries

Provide detailed insights into processed datasets (e.g., row/column counts, missing values, distribution of numerical columns).
Saved Analyses

Allow customers to save and reload their analysis workflows.
Build an intuitive dashboard to manage saved analyses.
Interactive Workflows

Offer a workspace where users can interact with their data (e.g., live data editing, combining sources, and generating reports).
Future AI/ML Capabilities

Keep the architecture modular to integrate predictive analytics, clustering, or classification models later.
Leverage preprocessed and validated data for these advanced analyses.
Implementation Recommendations
Use Pandas for all data processing in the backend.
Rely on Angular Material for interactive and clean UI design.
Maintain modularity by keeping preview, normalization, transformation, and analytics features decoupled.
Start small: Prioritize functionality like data summaries and basic visualizations to establish a functional Analytics Hub quickly.
Gradually introduce advanced features based on customer feedback and scalability requirements.
This phased approach ensures a strong foundation for the Analytics Hub, allowing for iterative improvements while delivering immediate value. Tomorrow, we can start by focusing on real-time preview updates and data normalization tools.
